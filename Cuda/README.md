# Cuda Implementation
This is the cuda implementation of the Neural Network
### Compilation
This is written for cuda.

It can be compiled with the following shell command: </br>
**Insert command here**
### Running the Code
The user also needs to specify the number of iterations that they would like to do, this is done by adding an integer after running the binary.</br>
Example: To run gradient descent for 100 iterations add '100' after running the binary </br>
**Insert command here**
### Running the code on the discovery cluster
In this repo there is a script called NN_cuda.bash. In this script I include both the compile shell command and the command to execute the code for 100 iterations. The user only needs to **modify the script for their name and directory** on the discovery cluster and execute:</br>
**bsub< NN_cuda.bash**
